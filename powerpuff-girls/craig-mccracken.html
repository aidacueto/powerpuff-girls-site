	    <p class="craig__text"><span class="craig__important">Craig McCracken</span> is an American animator, writer, and director best known for creating The Powerpuff Girls. Born on March 31, 1971, in Pennsylvania and raised in California, McCracken grew up obsessed with drawing and cartoons. He went on to study animation at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), where his creativity began to shine.</p>
        <p class="craig__text">In 1992, he made a student short called <span class="craig__important">“Whoopass Stew! The Whoopass Girls in: A Sticky Situation”</span>, featuring three cute but powerful superheroes. After joining Cartoon Network, he reworked the idea into <span class="craig__important">The Powerpuff Girls</span>, replacing the “Whoopass” formula with “Chemical X.” The series officially premiered in 1998 and quickly became popular.</p>
        <p class="craig__text">The show premiered in 1998 and became a massive hit, known for its bright visuals, clever humor, and mix of cuteness and action. It ran for six seasons, inspired a movie, and made Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup household names.</p>
        <p class="craig__text">Afterward, McCracken went on to create Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, Wander Over Yonder, and Kid Cosmic. His creative style and storytelling have made him one of the most influential figures in modern animation.</p>
